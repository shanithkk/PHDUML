Prediction of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

This project is used for analysing a person who have a chance to get heart disease or not.
in this project 6 different machine learning algorithm are used they are
- Naive Bayes Algorithm
- Random forest algorithm
- Logistic regression
- Tenser flow
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree

and the result of these algorithm are compared for making a decision which algorithm is more accurate.
