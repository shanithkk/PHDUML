TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Googleâ€™s Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well!<br/>

Let us first try to understand what the word TensorFlow actually mean!<br/>

TensorFlow is basically a software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs where:<br/>

nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations.<br/>
edges in the graph represent the multidimensional data arrays (called tensors) communicated between them. (Please note that tensor is the central unit of data in TensorFlow)..</p></td>
